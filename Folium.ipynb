While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as **plotly**, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. **Folium**, on the other hand, is completely free.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"button":false,"new_sheet":false,"run_control":{"read_only":false}},"source":["## Table of Contents\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n","\n","1.
